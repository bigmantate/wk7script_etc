USB Customization

I created an OS onto a USB drive with Persistance. I decided to go with Arch Linux. 
It took a few tries since you start from scratch and use only the command line to set up the operating system.
It was well worth it and I learned more from not getting it on the first try.
To customize it I added the internet browser Chromium because the one that came with it was limited in my opinion.
I also added the GUI KDE Plasma which I am still getting familiar with.
