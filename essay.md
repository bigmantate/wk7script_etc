Response to An Industry Guide to Becoming a Software Engineer

By bigmantate

  Author Bill Langenberg starts the article advising an emphasis on understanding core principals 
of Computer Science. Many people interested in the position of Software Engineer may think that they 
would need to just have superior programming skills to justify their position. In the section Core 
Computer Science Skills he makes a good connection to developing apps and knowing things such as 
byte allocation and how memory works in general. As I progress in my education in the Networking field 
it is becoming more clear that learning core principals will help my general understanding in how things 
all work together. All good knowledge should have a very strong base in fundamentals in my opinion.

  Another bit of practical advice is to learn one core language very well. To pick one that is your go
to language but then also to be proficient in most others and to be able to use other tools. This helps in 
code reviews because knowing one extremely well will help with the other languages you will 
encounter. Later in the article there is an emphasis on Linux, being able to use git, and understanding 
RSA keys. This is more broad based knowledge that will help you master the individual niche that you 
settle on. Linux and github have a very large community that will only help hone your skills you develop 
in programming. This section highlights the tool of scripting in Linux that I have noticed can be beyond 
valuable. It goes hand in hand with programming and code review to be able to write running scripts to 
help make you ever more efficient.

  In the section Software Engineering in the Wild he has a section about basic security. Once again 
many people going for this profession may believe that this isnâ€™t any of their business. I believe and the 
author conveys that is far from true, instead it is important to be a complete package. Knowing about 
basic security when writing code is the first line of defense in protecting your own work. Being able to 
harden your own code against cross-site scripting and SQL injection for example is something that 
makes sense to be aware of from the onset. Also there is an importance placed on encryption, and 
keeping things safe and not in the open such as email logins or Facebook account credentials. It is not 
necessary so the author reiterates the habit of being clean, with no more information exposed than 
absolutely necessary. 

  Later in the article the subject of what to do if you are stuck not knowing what to do. I 
appreciate the general rule he lays forth of trying to work on it yourself for thirty minutes to an hour 
before interrupting a coworker for advice on how to proceed. Knowing when to ask but not relying on 
others exclusively and becoming that dreaded person to work with. 

  In the conclusion of the article it states the importance of keeping busy whether it be an 
internship or on your own. There are so many tools at our fingertips these days that if an internship is
not in the cards there are plenty of projects out there to work on that will help develop your skills. I 
really appreciate the point where the author writes about how long of a process it is to get to a high 
level as a Software Engineer. These are not skills that develop overnight so patience but persistence will 
win the day.
